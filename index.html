<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is <b><em>a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other</b></em>. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <b>HTTP Request</b> to a <b>server</b>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <b>web browser</b>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> <br>HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <b><em>text content</em></b> which describes "what you see"
  and <b><em>markup</em></b> which describes "how it looks".
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
